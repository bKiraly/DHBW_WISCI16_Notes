Conclusion:
All-in-all the higher employment rate brought about by Macrons policies will cause the aggregate supply curve to shift to the right. The aggregate demand curve will also shift to the right due to the higher employment rate and thus higher disposable income.

The Long-term AD curve behaves similarly to the Short-term variant, thus the same line is used to represent it. The Long-term and short-term AS curve only differs in the different expectations of the market. Since errors in expectations are near-impossible to forecast, I'll just assume the effects of Macrons policies are less significant than the market expects.
