Tort Law
“A body of rights, obligations, and remedies that is applied by courts in civil proceedings to provide relief for persons who have suffered harm from the wrongful acts of others”. 
-The person who sustains injury or suffers pecuniary damage as the result of tortious conduct is known as the plaintiff, and the person who is responsible for inflicting the injury and incurs liability for the damage is known as the defendant or tortfeasor.
-The general function of tort law is the protection of the individual’s sphere against unlawful intrusion.
-The term “torts” does not exist under German Law, instead the BGB regulates “unlawful acts” (unerlaubte handlungen).
-In accident cases, the primary objective is to provide for victims compensation.
-In the violation of privacy rights, tort law is primarily concerned with providing satisfaction and ensuring a lasting settlement of the conflict, rather than economic compensation to the victim.
-In cases of injury to economic and commercial interests, prevention and deterrence and regulatory functions are the main elements.
-The great majority of personal injuries are covered in DE by public insurance, and social security compensation systems.
-In the area of property loss (e.g. automobile accidents), third party insurance has displaced and replaced tort law to a considerable extent. 
-In the area of non-patrimonial wrongs (e,g. pain and suffering, violation of privacy and defamation) rely more on traditional concepts of tort liability although calculation of damages cannot be prescribed in exact and objective terms

Divisions of Tort Law in Germany
-There are three types of torts characterized by the degree of fault requisite:
-Tort Liability based on Fault.
-When a person injures unlawfully the life, body, health, freedom or property of another person intentionally or negligently (§823 BGB)

Protected Rights
-Life.  E.g. A wrongful death action by the victim’s dependents entitled to support.
-Person, Health. E.g. Infliction of pain to a person, medical treatment (operations, injections) nervous breakdown.
-Liberty.  E.g. restriction of freedom of movement by means of threat and prosecution.
-Property. It is merely confined to legal ownership E.g. If an owner is prevented from using his vehicle. Pure economic loss is outside the scope of the BGB.
-Other Rights may include industrial property rights such as patents, trademarks and copyrights.
Defamation cases are protected under §823 I BGB in conjunction with the criminal code provisions and the rules in media laws.

Conduct and Causation
-There must be a causal connection between the violation of the victim’s rights and the corresponding damage. The defendant’s conduct must be the cause of the victim’s injury and the victim’s injury must have led to the damages claimed.
Unlawfulness
-The defendant’s conduct must be unlawful. E.g by asserting self-defense, necessity, use of force in defense of property, or the victim’s consent.

Fault
-The violation of a legally protective right must be culpable meaning intentional or negligent. Negligence is defined under (§276 I BGB).

Tort Liability Under a Presumption of Fault (§§831, 832, 833 II, 834, 836-838 BGB)
-§§831 and 832 BGB deal with civil liability for third persons.

 
Strict Liability.  This approach differs form the general thrust of the liability rules and can occur under different provisions outside the BGB. 
-This type of liability might coexist with other forms of liability prescribed under the BGB and the Product Liability Act and other statutes imposing strict liability on operators like the Liability Statute (Haftpflichgesetz), the Air Traffic Act (Luftverkehrgesetz), the Atomic Energy Act (Atomgesetz) and Water Management Act (Wasserhaushaltgesetz)


Overview of the Provisions of Product Liability
-“Product Liability” refers to the liability of manufacturers and suppliers for personal injury or damage to property caused by a defective product.

-PL in tort comprises liability for breach of a general duty of care (Verkehrspflicht) under §823 I BGB and breach of statutory duty (Schutzgesetz) under §823 II BGB.Most product liability claims are brought on the basis of a breach of a duty of care


Breach of a Duty of Care
-The main feature of the case law of the Bundesgerichtshof is that the claimant does not have to prove fault on behalf of the manufacturer (or his employees) but only that the product was defective at the time of marketing.

-The Bundesgerichtshof has identified three types of defects: (i) manufacturing defects, (ii) design defects and (iii) instruction defects.
Under this category, if the claimant can prove the existence of a defect, it is for the manufacturer to show that it did everything necessary and reasonable to discover and avoid the defect.


Breach of a Statutory Duty
-Under this category, manufacturers are liable for intentional or negligent breach of a statutory or regulatory provision meant to protect other persons. (E.g. Appliances and Product Safety Act, the Food Act, the Drug Act, the Medical Devices Act and the Criminal Code).

-The claimant needs to prove the breach of a statutory/regulatory duty, and the defendant will usually need to show that this breach did not occur through fault.

The Product Liability Act
-The German Product Liability Act of 1989 (PLA) implements the EU Product Liability Directive to introduce liability for defective products.

-The PLA sets stricter limits on recoverable damages as well as on the group of liable persons.

-The PLA applies only to products that were put on the market after 1 January 1990.

-Under the PLA, the manufacturers and others in the chain of distribution are liable simply for having put the defective product into circulation regardless of fault.

-Everyone who suffers damage resulting from the product’s defect can bring a claim.

-There are two limitations regarding property damage:
	-only damage to another thing is covered; and 
	-only property for private use is protected (property used for business purposes is out from the scope of said statute).

-In cases involving insufficient instructions, third parties may be liable (specially a dealer who may be under a special duty to provide the product with instruction for correct application and use.

-The PLA contains a provision extending liability to “quasi producers” (any person who presents him-self as the product’s manufacturer, any person putting his name or trademark or who imported the product in EC and supplier of a product the manufacturer of which cannot be identified.

-Under §3 PLA, a product is considered to be “defective” when it does not provide the safety which one is entitled to expect, in particular:
	-its presentation;
	-the use to which it could reasonably be expected that it would be put, and
	-the time when it was put into circulation.

-Liability for Damages in the Case of Bodily Injury
	-In case of injury to a person's body or damage to his health, compensation consists by reimbursing the costs of the treatment and costs incurred by pecuniary prejudice sustained by the injured party as a result of the temporary or permanent suspension or reduction of his earning capacity or the resultant increase in his needs. (§9 PLA)
 

-Maximum Amount of Compensation

-The party liable to pay damages shall be liable only up to a maximum amount of €85 million.
-When several injured parties are involved, the individual compensation should be reduced pro-rata to the maximum total given (§10 PLA).
-Indemnification in Case of Damage to Property
-The injured party shall pay for damages up to an amount of €500 himself. (§11 PLA).
-Limitation
-The limitation period to claim damages for defective products is three years. (§12 (1) PLA).
-The provisions on limitation periods of the BGB apply mutatis mutandis.


-Expiration of Claims
-The expiration of claims is ten years from the time when the producer put into circulation the product, which caused the damage. (§13 PLA).
-Exceptions are claims declared final and absolute and claims based on other enforceable documents and claims based of an out-of court settlement or recognized by means of a contractual declaration.
	-Conditions to Claim Liability under the BGB and the PLA

Plaintiff has to prove: 
	-the defective condition of the product;
	-the damage; 
	-the causal nexus between defect and damage;
	-the attribution of the defective product to the defendant.

Defendant has the burden of proof for certain defenses such as: 
	-he did not put the product into circulation; 
	-the manufacturer did not produce the product for sale or other distribution in the course of his business;
	-the product comply with mandatory regulations at the time of	distribution;
	-the product’s defect could not be discovered at the time of distribution;
	-the defect is due to the design of the complete product or to 	instructions of its producer or assembler.


Damage Law 
-The law of restitution or damages is contained in the general part of the law of obligations of the BGB (§§249-254)
-These rules apply to all damage claims whether they arise from tort, contract or another source. 
-The rules are supplemented by several more specific provisions in the subchapter pertaining to personal injury (§§842-846 BGB) and property damage (§§848-851 BGB).

-There are two basic methods: 
	-Repair of the damage in kind (§249 BGB)
	-Compensatory damages in monetary form (§251 BGB)

-If repair of the damage is possible but would impose a disproportionate burden on the defendant, he has the right to compensate the victim with money (§251 II BGB).     
-In practice, financial compensation is the overwhelming rule.
-The plaintiff may claim damages for medical treatment, loss of earnings, repair bills and other expenses, including loss of profits (§252 BGB). Said rule is supplemented by §§842-843 BGB. 
-Said rules provide that the duty to compensate the victim includes damages ‘when the act produces an injury (§842) and damages resulting from the fact that ‘the earning capacity of the injured person has been eliminated or reduced as a result of the injury or when his needs are increased (§843).

	
-As a general rule, the loss suffered must be precisely quantified and itemized when defendant contest the amount proven.
-If the precise damages cannot be determined, §287 I of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung ZPO) allows the court to determine and quantify the damages.

Non-Pecuniary Damage
-§253 I BGB provides that non-pecuniary damages are allowed only in cases provided by the statute.
-§253 I BGB provides a general cause of action for pain and suffering in all cases involving harm to body, health, freedom or sexual self-determination. -This action includes strict liability actions and breach of contract claims as well.
-Under German law an award for pain and suffering is limited to compensation for the elements of injury.
-To determine the amount of financial compensation, the courts take into consideration two elements: (i) the situation and suffering of the victim; and (ii) the conduct and position of the wrongdoer.

Contributory Negligence
-The German doctrine stipulates that if a person was injured in part due to his/her own negligence (his/her negligence "contributed" to the accident), the injured party would not be entitled to collect any damages (money) from another party who supposedly caused the accident.
§254 BGB provides for a reduction of the defendant’s liability to the extent that the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to the harm.

-In practice, §254 BGB overlaps with similar provisions in strict liability statutes, e.g. §9 of the Road Traffic Act or §6 of the Product Liability Act.

-Under §840 I BGB, If more than one person is responsible for damage arising from a tort, then they are jointly and severally liable.

Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
-Injunctive Relief is a discretionary power of the court in which the court, upon deciding that the plaintiff's rights are being violated, balances the irreparability of injuries and inadequacy of damages if an injunction were not granted against the damages that granting an injunction would cause.
I-njunctive Relief is expressly contained in some articles of the BGB (E.g. It is expressly allowed for the protection of ownership rights §1004 and of the right of possession §862 I BGB as well as the protection of one’s name §12 BGB).
-German courts will in appropriate cases, grant injunctions for the protection of all the rights listed in §823 BGB (Liability in Damages) by way of analogy to §1004 BGB.


Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
-German courts will in appropriate cases, grant injunctions for the protection of all the rights listed in §823 BGB (Liability in Damages) by way of analogy to §1004 BGB.
 
-German Procedural law, requires that declaratory relief can be granted only if other remedies are not available (principle of subsidiarity  §256 Code of Civil Procedure)
 
-Declaratory relief can also be sought if the dispute is limited to the issue of liability while the amount of damages is not contested.

	
	
Property Law 
-Basic Concepts
	-Sachenrechts which means “law of things” is translated as the law of property or of rights in rem. It refers to the part of private law, which is concerned with rights a person has in direct relation to a thing.

-The concept of thing covers any substantive inanimate object (§90 BGB) both movables and land.

-Sachenrechts covers possession (besitz) and limited rights in rem, mainly rights of use and various kinds of security interests.

-Sachenrechts does not include intellectual property rights such as patents, trade marks or copyright.

-The main body of property law is contained in the third book of the BGB §854 to §1296 with §§90-103 containing definitions of the basic legal terms such as ‘thing’ (sache), ‘component’ (Bestandteil; Zübehor, Inventar) and Fruits (Früchte).

-The BGB Chapter on Sachenrechts is concerned with matters of substantive law and not with procedural issues.

Possession
-Possession is regulated in the BGB under §§854-872.
-Possession is characterized by mere physical not necessary legal control over a thing pursuant to §854 BGB.
-Possession is normally established by acquiring immediate power over an object, either de facto or by means of an agreement if the object can be brought under the possessor’s control without hindrance. 

-The figure of “Agent in Possession” is regulated under §855 BGB. If a person is in control of a thing on behalf of another person – to whom he renders services in his household or business subject to his direction- only that other person is considered to be the possessor.

-The figure of “Indirect Possession” is regulated under §868 BGB. If a person possesses the thing as a usufructuary, pledgee, lessee, tenant, depositary or in any similar legal relationship subject to which he is entitled or obliged to be in possession for a limited period of time vis-a vis another person, that other person is considered to have (indirect) possession regardless of his actual power of control. 


Ending of Possession

-Pursuant to §856, possession comes to an end as a result of the processor giving up actual control of the thing or losing actual control in another way.

-Possession does not come to an end as a result of the possessor being prevented in a way that is temporary in nature from exercising control.

Unlawful Interference with Possession
-Under §858, possession obtained as a result of unlawful interference is defective. Unlawful interference is defined as depriving the possessor of his possession or infringing upon his possession without the possessor consent or other legal authorization.
-Pursuant to §859 (1), the possessor may use force to defend himself against unlawful interference.
-When a movable thing is taken away from the possessor, the possessor may use force to remove it from the interferer §859 (2).
-If a piece of land is deprived of possession by unlawful interference, the possessor may recover its possession immediately by removing the interferer. §859 (3).
-The possessor must allow the defectiveness of the possession to be asserted against him-self. §859 (4).
-Under §861 the possessor enjoys a claim on account of deprived possession by unlawful interference.
-The claim is excluded if the possessor or his predecessor in title obtained possession in the last year §861 (2).
-Under §862 the possessor enjoys a claim on account of interference or disturbance with possession. Under this section the possessor may seek a prohibitory injunction.
-The claim is excluded if the possessor or his predecessor in title of the disturber obtained possession in the last year before disturbance §862 (2).

Extinction of Claims
-Under §864, claims based on §§861-862 extinguishes at the end of one year after the act of unlawful interference.
-Extinction also occurs when established by a final & absolute judgment §864 (2)

Movables
-Acquisition by Means of Transaction 
	-§§929-935 BGB deal with the transfer of movable property.
	-As a general rule, there is only one way to transfer title to movables.
	-§929 provides that the owner of the thing must physically hand it over to the acquiring party and that both parties agree to the transfer of property.
	-There are three modifications to the basic rule concerning the physical transfer of the object:
	-If the purchaser is already in possession, mere agreement on the passing of property suffices to transfer title (§929) (E.g When the purchaser of a car is already in possession of the thing as a lessee).

-When the owner is in possession of the thing, the act of handing the object over to the purchaser can be replaced by an agreement between the owner and the purchaser providing that the purchaser shall only have ‘indirect possession’ (§930) (E.g. A Lease or a deposit agreement)

-If a third party is in possession of the thing, the handing over can be replaced by assigning the owner’s right to claim the object from that third party to the purchaser (§931)  (E.g. When an object that is to be transferred has been leased to a third party).
-Pursuant to §185 BGB a third party transfer is valid if the owner agrees to it, either before or after the transaction.

Good Faith Acquisition
-§§932-934 BGB stipulates bona fide or good faith acquisition from a non-owner.
-The purchaser is not in good faith if he knows or, due to gross negligence, ignores the fact that the thing in question is not owned by the transferor. (§932 BGB).
-The main principle in bona fide acquisitions depends not only on the purchaser good faith, but also on the transferor’s ability to transfer possession or to cause it to be transferred.
-A bona fide acquisition may be precluded if the thing was stolen, lost or got out of the owner’s immediate possession against his will or in any other way (§935 I BGB).
-With regards to money and negotiable instruments, the law protects the bona fide recipient even if the owner is not responsible for his loss or possession based on the idea that money and negotiable instruments are meant to circulate as freely as possible §935 II BGB.


Acquisition by Law
-Movable property can be acquired by operation of law irrespective of the existence of an agreement.
	-E.g. When a person has possessed a thing for ten years in good faith, then he may acquire the ownership by prescription pursuant to §§937-945 BGB.
	
-Prescription is interrupted by loss of proprietary possession within a period of one year if the possessor losses the proprietary possession involuntarily. §940 BGB.
-There goods are processed, the person in charge of the processing, acquires property unless the value resulting from processing is considerably lower than the price of the materials involved. §950 BGB.
-Appropriation of movable things is regulated under §§958-964 BGB.
-Finding and possession of movable things is regulated under §§969-984 BGB.
-The term for a finder to acquire the ownership of the thing after notification of the finding to the competent authority is six months pursuant to §973 BGB.


Property
-Property or Ownership is regulated under §§903-924 BGB.
 
Definition
-Property is described by §903 BGB as the right to dispose of a thing at will and to exclude others from any interference, legal restrictions or third party rights.

Restriction of Ownership
-Pursuant to §905 BGB, the right of the owner of a plot of land extends to the space above the surface and to the subsoil under the surface 

Acquisition and loss of ownership of Plots of Land
-Title 2 §§903-924 BGB regulates the form to transfer ownership of a plot of land, which is generally made before a public notary between the alienor and the acquirer.
-Pursuant to §927 BGB if the plot of land has been in the proprietary possession of another for 30 years, it may be excluded by public notice procedure.
-The person who obtained the exclusory order obtains ownership by having himself registered in the Land Register as owner. §927(2) BGB.

Protection Against Infringements
-The BGB grants the owner the right to defend his property against various kinds of infringements under §§985-1007. Among the most relevant provisions are:

Emoluments of the possessor who makes no payment
-If a possessor of a thing has obtained possession without payment, he is obliged to return to the owner the emoluments that he takes before litigation under the provisions of unjust enrichment. §988 BGB

Liability of Possessor Without Knowledge
-When the possessor obtains the possession without good faith or when he later discovers that he is not entitled to possession, he is liable to the owner from the data of acquisition. §990 BGB

Liability of the Wrongful Possession
-The possessor is liable to the owner under the provisions on damages in tort when he obtains possession by unlawful interference or by a criminal offense. §992 BGB

Right of Pursuit
-The owner of a thing located in a plot of land has a legal claim against the possessor of the plot of land §1005 BG

Claims of the Former Possessor, Exclusion in the case of Knowledge

-The claim is excluded if the former possessor was not in good faith on the acquisition of possession or if he has given up possession. §1007 (3) BGB

Coownership
-Co-ownership of things and plots of land and claims arising from co-ownership are regulated under §§1008-1011 BGB

Usufruct
-It refers to the right of an individual to use and enjoy the property of another provided its substance is neither impaired nor altered. This right is usually granted or held in common ownership as long as the property is not modified, damaged or destroyed.

-Usufruct in things is regulated under §§1030-1067; usufruct in rights is regulated under §§1068-1084 and usufruct in property under §§1085-1089.

Easement
-It generally refers to the right of an individual to use another’s person property for a specific purpose or to perform work on such property without possessing it.

Trade and Company Law
Overview of Business Associations
Under German law, there are two types of business associations: (i) Corporations and (ii) Partnerships.
German business law provides for three forms of corporations:

The Stock Company (Aktiengesellchaft AG)
-The Public Limited Partnership by Shares (Komanditgesellschaft auf Aktien KGaA)

-The Limited Liability Company (Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung  GmbH)

-The most important corporate forms under German law in practice are the GmbH and the AG.

-Civil Law and Commercial Law provide for five forms of partnerships:
	-The Partnership under the Civil Code (BGB Gesellschaft)
	-The Non-Trading Partnership under the Partnership Act 1994 (Partnerschafftgesellschaft)
	-The General Partnership (Offene Handelsgesellschaft OHG)
	-The Limited Partnership (Komanditgesellschaft KG)
	-The Dormant Partnership (Stille Gesellschaft)

-The Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB), which contains general rules on the formation, performance and enforcement of contracts and on the basic types of contractual agreements for legal transactions between private entities.
-The Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB), which contains special rules concerning transactions among businesses and commercial partnerships.
-The Private Limited Companies Act (GmbH-Gesetz) and the Public Limited Companies Act (Aktiengesetz), covering the two most common corporate structures in Germany – the "GmbH" and the "AG"
