Web Programming
===============

## Web 2.0

### Paradigm

* Internet as a *platform*
* Cater to niches

### The long tail

* Most of the traffic on the internet is *niche* traffic
* Most sales come from unpopular products

### Technologies Enabling Web 2.0

* AJAX
* REST
* APIs
* etc.

## Sockets

TCP and UDP (see Communications Systems)

### Streams

* Streams break data up into elements
* These elements are transmitted and read by by another bit of code

## Web server

* Gets source from files
* Is on the internet
* Uses HTTP(S)

## TLS

* Predecessor: SSL
* Used for HTTPS
* Cipher negotiation
* Optional: server checks client certificate
* Symmetric encryption

### MitMA

* Man in the Middle Attack
* The attacker inpersonates the server
* The clients sees an invalid certificate or a self-signed certificate

## Service Oriented Architecture

* Microservices
* Small applications that do different things
* Enabling platform- and language independent use and reuse
* Used by applications and other services
* Independence from the concrete implementation
* Legacy applications can be broken down into services

### Characteristics

* Standards
* Security
* Simplicity
* Distribution
* Loose coupling
* Service delivery
* Process oriented

### Web services

* Services on the web
* Components
	* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) -> XML
	* WSDL (Web Service Description Language) -> XML
	* UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration protocol)
