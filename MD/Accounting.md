## Table of Contents

[TOC]

## Basic Definitions

> **IFRS**
	* In a narrow sense it might refer to the standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (*prefixed with IFRS*).
	* In a broad sense it might also refer to publications prefixed with *IAS, SIC, IFRIC*.

> **Standards** are principles to be applied by accountants.

> **Interpretations** are explanations of a complex principle and These have the same authority as standards.

> **Compliance with/Adaptations of** IFRS means, the application of Standards (IAS, IFRS) and Interpretations (SIC, IFRIC).

> **Convergence (Harmonization)** to IFRS means continuously reducing the difference between GAAP and IFRS.


## Development of IFRSs:

* Creation of Exposure Drafts (created by IASB)
* Exposure Draft is edited trough Discussion Papers which are created during Public discussions of an Exposure Draft
* If the majority votes for passing the Draft, if its a 
	* major issue a new Standard is developed or revised by IASB
	* minor issue it is dealt with in the Annual Improvements by IFRSIC or IASB:
* If necessary an Interpretation is also developed by IFRSIC.

> **Exposure Drafts** are developed by the IASB, before Standards/Interpretations/Annual Improvements, as a *specific proposal* for Standards/Interpretations/Annual Improvements.

&nbsp;
> **Discussion Papers** are created to discuss a specific feedback of an Exposure Draft.


## IFRS Foundation

> **Objectives of IFRS Foundation:**
>
* to develop high quality and understandable international financial reporting standards, that are accepted globally.
* to promote these standards and the adaptation of IFRS

&nbsp;
> **The IASB** (International Accounting Standards Board) is the standard setting body, that is responsible for issuing Exposure Drafts, Standards and Interpretations.

&nbsp;
> **The IFRSIC** (International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee) is a part of IASB and is responsibly for creating the Interpretations.

&nbsp;
> **The IFRSAC** (International Financial Reporting Standards Advisory Council) is a forum of organizations and individuals, interested in IFR (at least 30 person with different geographical and professional background).

&nbsp;
> **The ASAF** (Accounting Standards Advisory Forum) includes 12 global accounting standard setter + chairman.


## Conceptual framework

> **Conceptual Framework** *for Financial Reporting* (CF) is the foundation of IFRS. these are the base concepts for evaluation and development of standards and interpretations.

Parts:

1. Objective (new)
2. The reporting entity (empty)
3. Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information (new)
4. Old framework
	1. Assumptions
	2. Elements
	3. Recognition
	4. Measurements
	5. Capital maintenance

Concepts currently contained in the CF:

* Objectives of general purpose financial reporting
* Underlying assumption inherent in a set of financial statements
* Qualitative characteristics of useful financial statements
* Definitions of elements in the financial statements
* Recognition criteria to be met before recognizing an element
* measurement bases that may be used when measuring the elements
* concept and maintenance of capital

> **IAS 1**, *Presentation of Financial Statements* is the other base pillar of IFRS.

### General Purpose Financial Reporting

> The **objective** of General Purpose Financial Reporting is to provide useful financial information about the company to outside observers.




### Objectives
> The **objective** of financial statements is to provide useful financial information about the company to outside observers.

Users of financial information:

* Investors
* lenders
* creditors

#### Economic resources and claims against these resources
> **Economic resources** are called *assets*, claims against those resources by the owner(s) is called *equity* and claims against those resources by creditors are called *liabilities*. Resources and claims against those resources must always be *in balance*.

### Changes in economic resources
>**Changes in the economic resources of a company** are recorded in transactions. They are reported on an *accrual* and a *cash* basis. These are reported in the *income statement* and the *statement of cash flows* respectively.

&nbsp;
> **Financial performance** helps users understand the return made trough the use of an entity's economic resources.

&nbsp;
> **Accrual accounting** is achieved by recording elements (assets, liabilities, income, expenses and equity) when the definitions and recognition criteria are met.

&nbsp;
> The **cash flow** basis entails recording cash receipts, cash payments and in the periods in which they occur.

### Qualitative characteristics and Constraints

> **Fundamental qualitative characteristics** are those that are absolutely essential if the financial statements are to be useful. 

> **Enhancing qualitative characteristics** enhance this usefulness.

#### Qualitative characteristics
* Relevant
	* Predictive value $\rightarrow$ Can predict future outcomes
	* Confirmatory value $\rightarrow$ Can verify past outcomes
* Faithfully represented
	* Complete
		* Nature of the assets
		* Relevant numerical information
		* Meaning of numbers
		* Method to obtain these results
	* Neutral
		* Free from bias
	* Free from error
		* Description of the phenomenon
		* Methods to obtain the information
		* Estimates and their limitations need to be stated

#### Applying qualitative characteristics
* Identify economic phenomena
* Identify the type of information that makes it the most relevant
* Determine whether the information can be faithfully represented
#### Enhancing qualitative characteristics
Information needs to be

* Comparable
	* Compare to previous time periods (consistency)
	* Compare to other entities (standardization)
* Verifiable
	* independent observers can make sure the representation is faithful
	* Direct verification
	* indirect verification: Checking inputs and recalculating outputs
* Timeless
	* Information needs to be available in time for users to be able to use it
* Understandable
	* Clear and understandable

##### The cost constraints of useful information

* Market values
* Accepted formulas
* Detailed information

If expensive, ignore

> The two **recognition criteria** are as follows:
>
* the flow of future economic benefits caused by this element must be probable
* the element must have a cost/value that can be reliably measured

> *If information is still relevant it can be disclosed.*

## Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1)


The **objective of IAS 1** is to help us present general-purpose financial statements so that comparability is achieved between: 

* the entity's own financial statements in previous periods
* other entity's financial statements

The **objective of financial statements** is to be a structured representation of an entity's financial position, performance and cash flows that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions and showing the result of management's stewardship of the resources entrusted to it.

#### The five main statements:

* the statement of financial position (SOFP)
	* normally includes balances as at the end of the current period and end of the prior period
	* it must reflect the balances at the beginning of the prior period if there is a retrospective change in accounting policy, restatement of items or reclassification of items
* the statement of comprehensive income (SOCI)
	* in **a single statement** the statement of comprehensive income (this may be called the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income)
	* in **two separate statements** (one called the statement of profit or loss and the other called the statement of comprehensive income):
* the statement of changes in equity (SOCIE)
* the statement of cash flows (SOCF)
* the notes to the financial statements (Notes)

#### Accounting chain
* Transaction
* Source document
* Journal
* Ledger
* Trial Balance
* Detailed internal financial statements
* External financial statements

#### The 8 general features of financial statements:
* fair presentation & compliance with IFRS
	* Comply with international guidelines, fairly present your numbers.
	* In very extreme circumstances management may decide to deviate from IFRS if it wouldn't represent the financial data faithfully
	* Needs:
		* compliance with IFRS
		* 1 fundamental QC: 
			* faithful representation
		* 3 enhancing QCs:
			* relevance
			* comparability
			* understandability 			
* going concern
	* The going concern assumption states that the company will stay in market and not liquidate its assets in the foreseeable future (defined usually as one or two years).
* accrual basis
	* Everything is reported when it occurs.
* materiality and aggregation
* offsetting
	* subtracting an expense from an income or subtracting a liability from an asset, and showing the net amount
* frequency of reporting
	* Entities are required to produce financial statements at least annually. 
	* Entities are allowed, for practical reasons, to report on a 52-week period rather than a 365-day period.
	* for deviation a reason must be given and it has to be disclosed
* comparative information
	* Comparative information comes in three forms:
		* Minimum comparative information
			* We must show prior year information (for numerical and narrative information)
			* Prior year info for narrative info is only needed if relevant
			* Comparisons may be needed in reverse...
		* Voluntary additional comparative information
			* Extra comparative years can be given if we wish (e.g. 2 prior periods (PP) instead of just the minimum 1 PP)
			* We can give extra comparatives for
				* just 1 statement if we wish, but
				* the notes supporting this statement must include all PPs
			* All PPs must comply with IFRS
		* Compulsory additional comparative information
			* used when there are changes in accounting policy and reclassification of items
			* An extra comparative year must be given if a ‘material retrospective adjustment’ is made
			* This extra comparative year refers to the opening balances of the prior period (i.e. the closing balances of the period prior to the prior period)
			* This extra comparative year:
				* only applies to the SOFP
				* but does not apply to the notes
* consistency of presentation
	* Consistency refers to:
	* presentation/classification of items being the same
	* from one period to the next
	* it is essential for comparability
	* thus, if presentation or classification must change, it is accounted for as a reclassification


###Financial Statements in General

Anual report includes the 5 main statements and other documents voluntarily, due to legal requirements, due to cmmunity concerns.

####Financial statements must have:
* the name of the entity
* the fact that the financial statements apply to an individual entity or a group of entities;
* relevant dates: date of the end of the reporting period for the statement of financial position or the period covered for other statements (e.g. statement of cash flows);
* presentation currency (e.g. pounds, dollars, rands); and the
* level of rounding used (i.e. figures in a column that are rounded to the nearest thousand, such as C100 000 shown as C100, should be headed up ‘C’000’)

#### Elements of financial information

* Recognition
	* Record probable events, you may also report possible events
* Reliable measurement
	* Audit it
* Initial recognition
	* Report it
* Subsequent
	* Followup
* Disclosure
	* Detail about an event

#### Measurements

* Historical cost method
	* Original buying price
* Present value method
	* The value of the item today
* Realizable value method
	* The price it could be sold at
* Current cost method
	* The price of getting that item today

#### Capital
Two methods

* Financial - How much equity is there
* Production - How much the company can produce

Requirement: Directors approval
Group financial statements -> grouped by year and detailed breakdowns
Different year layouts

> **Assets** are resources controlled by the entity as a result of a past event from which future economic benefit is expected.

&nbsp;

> **Liabilities** are present obligations of the entity as a result of a past event the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources.

&nbsp;

>**Equity** is residual assets after removing liabilities.

&nbsp;

> **Net income** is the net increase in economic benefits during the accounting period during the accounting period in the form of increase in assets or decrease in liabilities resulting in an increase in equity other than the contributions from equity participants. Positive net income is called **income**, negative net income is called **expense**.



## Accounting policies, estimates and errors (IAS 8)

### Accounting policies

> **Accounting policies** are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial statements.

#### Choosing and applying accounting policies:
* Find a relevant IFRS and apply the policies contained therein
* If the IFRS contains guidance that is integral, any requirements contained in the guidance must also be applied
* If there is no relevant IFRS, then there aren't any compulsory requirements
	* You have to develop your own policy, that is relevant and reliable
		* Faithful representation
		* Neutral
		* Complete
	* Development guidelines:
		* Similar issues in IFRS
		* CF
		* Other standard setters
		* Industry accepted practices
		* Accounting literature		

#### Accounting policies in the IFRSs:
* Some IFRSs give you no choice in AP (e.g. inventories must be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value)
* Some IFRSs give you a choice of AP (e,g. PPE may be measured using the cost model or the revaluation model)


#### Accounting policies must include the:
* measurement basis (or bases) used
* other accounting policies used that are considered relevant

#### A change in accounting policy is either:
* compulsory: if required by an IFRS
* voluntary: if it provides information that is
	* reliable and
	* more relevant.

*Changes must be disclosed*
	
> **Transitional provisions** are the instructions that are sometimes included in a new IFRS on how to account for the change from the old IFRS to the new IFRS
*If Transitional provisions are given, they take precedence*

&nbsp;

> The general guidance in IAS 8 requires that a change in accounting policy be applied retrospectively, unless it is impracticable to do so.

&nbsp;

> It is **impracticable** for an entity to apply a requirement in IFRSs if the entity ‘cannot apply it after making every reasonable effort to do so’.

* Retro $\rightarrow$ Change the accounting standard for the past two years as well
	* Previous years financial records are *fixed*. They cannot retroactively be changed
	* Adjustments need to be added to previous years in the current report
* Pro $\rightarrow$ Change is effective only *after the decision to change.* Previous years are unaffected.


#### Disclosure of a change in Accounting Policy includes:

* Description of what policy changed
* Explanation of *why* (unless it was a compulsory change)
* Effect on each line item
* Extra comparative yr in the SOFP

### Estimates

> A change in **estimate** is an adjustment of the carrying amount of an asset or a liability, or the amount of the periodic consumption of an asset, that results from the assessment of the present status of, and expected future benefits and obligations associated with, assets and liabilities.
*Changes in estimates are always pro.* 

&nbsp;

> **Gross amount** - Amount *before* adjustment

&nbsp;

> **Carrying amount** - Amount carried over to the financial statements.

Two methods:

* Reallocation
	* Assume that the current value is correct, and calculate the depreciation depending on the expected life
	* Preferred by Prof.
* Cumulative catch-up
	* Assume the old estimate is wrong, and correct it in the current year based on that


#### Disclosure of a change in accounting estimate includes:

* Brief description of ‘what’
* Effect on each line item

### Correction of Errors


#### There are essentially three categories of errors:

* Current period errors
	* errors, that happen and are discovered in the current year
	* no disclosure needed
* Prior period errors that are immaterial
* Prior period errors that are material

> Prior period errors are errors that happened before the current year but which are only discovered in the current year. 
Such errors include the effects of: 
* mathematical mistakes
* mistakes in applying accounting policies
* oversights 
* misinterpretations of facts
* fraud.

*Since IFRSs only ever apply to material items, immaterial prior period errors are not corrected in terms of this standard. Meaning they have to be corrected, but not disclosed.*

> **Retrospective restatement** is defined as correcting the recognition, measurement and disclosure of elements in the financial statements as if a prior period error had never occurred.

Errors are all retro. (restate figures)
Restated figures are on the new report.

#### Disclosure of a correction of error includes:

* Brief descript of ‘what’
* Effect on each line item
* Two years of comparatives in the SOFP

## Foreign Currency Transaction (IAS 21, IFRS 7, IFRS 9)

> **Foreign currency** is a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.
> **Functional currency** is defined as the currency of the primary economic activities of the entity.

&nbsp;

> A **foreign currency transaction** is a transaction that is denominated or requires settlement in a foreign currency.

&nbsp;

> An exchange difference is the difference resulting from translating a given number of units of one currency into another currency at different exchange rates.

#### Monetary items and non-monetary items

> Monetary items are items that are either cash or can be quickly converted to cash, such as:
>
* Cash
* Accounts receivable
* Accounts payable
* Provisions to be settled in cash

&nbsp;

> **Exchange rate** is the ratio of exchange between the two currencies

#### Dates

Different dates need to be determined, because the *exchange rate* fluctuates.

* Transaction date
	* The date t which point you receive the risk and reward of the item
		* FOB (Free on Board)
			* Risk transfers as soon as the item *is shipped*
		* CIF (Carriage, Insurance and Freight)
			* The risk transfers at the end of shipping
		* DAT (Delivered at Terminal)
			* The risk transfers at arrival
		* DDP (Delivered, Duty Payed)
			* The risk transfers when all duties are cleared and the item is picked up

			
> **Settlement date** is the date on which payment changes hands

&nbsp;

> **Reporting date** is the financial year-end of the local entity (or any other date upon which the financial information is to be reported).

&nbsp;

> Spot exchange rate is the exchange rate for immediate delivery.

&nbsp;

> **Monetary items** must be translated at the end of each reporting period, at the closing rate.

&nbsp;

> **Closing rate** is defined as the spot exchange rate at reporting date.

Depending on the current state of delivery the books need to be adjusted for the exchange rate

It must be declared how you deal with changes in exchange rate.

#### Paying debts (accounts payable)

A *profit/loss on foreign exchange* needs to be recorded when paying debt or receiving payments from debtors at a different exchange rate than it was incurred on.

#### Foreign loans

> **Loans** are a form of debt that needs to be repaid *with interest.*

For *foreign loans* the interest payments need to be made in the foreign currency, thus the exchange rate needs to be accounted for. The foreign exchange profit/loss needs to be accounted for on each payment.

The debt needs to be accounted for at the *average annual interest rate*.

Example
: A debt in the FC is incurred at an interest rate of 10% p.a. with a minimum payment of 20% p.a. In 5 years the company pays back all the money

| Debt (FC) | Exchange rate | Debt (LC) | Interest expense | Exchange p/l  | Cash |
|----------:|--------------:|----------:|-----------------:|--------------:|-----:|
| 100       | 10	    | 1000	| N/A		   | N/A	   | 1000 |
| 90	    | 5		    | 450	| -100	           | 550	   |  900 |
| 80	    | 20	    | 1600	| -100		   | -1450	   |  500 |
| 70	    | 10	    | 700	| -100		   | 1000	   |  300 |
| 0	    | 15	    | 0		| -100		   | -450	   | **-750** |
| Total | (profits /| expense) | **-400** 	   | **-350**	   | **-750** |


#### Foreign currency dominated non-monetary items

These are not affected by exchange rate (i.e. they are accounted for at the *price and exchange rate of purchase*). Inventories kept in foreign currencies need to be accounted for at the *sale* of the inventory in the local currency.

### Functional currencies and presentation currencies

> IAS 21 allows entities to *present* their financial statements in any **presentation currency**. It however requires the entity to operate and calculate with its **functional currency**, that is the most used currency in the primary region of the entities operations.

All transactions need to be calculated in the functional currency, and then converted to any presentation currency in the reports.

## Statement of cash flows (IAS 7)

> **Cash and cash equivalents** are currency assets, or assets quickly convertible to currency.

&nbsp;

> **Cash flows** are inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents

#### Types of Activities in the Statement of Cash Flows

* Operating activities
	* are principle revenue producing activities and other activities.
* Investment activities
	* are the acquisition and disposal of long term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.
* Financing activities
	* result in changes in size, composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity.

#### The Methods of Stating Cash Flows

* Direct method
	* Cash receipts
	* Add them up
* Indirect method
	* Profit before tax
	* Cash generated from operations

##### The direct method

It is important to balance out the statement of creditors and Bank.

Each T-account needs to be balanced separately

See book p. 1230ff for examples

##### The indirect method

Profit + Non-cash items = Operating profit before working capital
OPbWC - Trade receivable + Prepaid expenses - Inventories - Notes paid = 
Cash generated form operations - Interest paid - Dividends paid - Income tax = Net cash flow from operations

##### Bank overdrafts

> **Bank overdrafts** are considered *loans.* They *must* be explained in a note on the Statement of Cash flows.

#### Non-Cash Flow Transactions

> **Non-cash flow transactions** that may significantly affect future cash flows should be disclosed in a note.

## Inventories

> **Inventories** are assets to be sold, or the raw materials thereof

Properties

* Property plant and equipment
* Investment properties
* Inventories

* Retailers
	* Merchandise
* Manufacturer
	* Raw materials
	* Work-in-Progress
	* Finished goods
* Service provider
	* Consumable stores

> Stocks, bonds and biological assets are reported separately

Initial measurement

* Cost to purchase
* Conversion costs
* Other costs to bring it to current location and condition

### Taxes and Duties

Companies can usually claim back the VAT for the inventories they purchase, as theses will be paid by the consumers when these inventories are sold

* Inwards - Buying something
	* Included in costs of inventory
* Outward - Selling something
	* Included in selling expense
	* Selling expense = cost of inventory sold + selling expense

#### Rebates

* Buying for less (reduces cost of inventory)
* Assist in selling (reduces selling expenses)

#### Discounts

* Trade discount or bulk discount - Included in the negotiation price
* Cash discount - Reward for paying in cash
* Early settlement discount - Reward for paying quickly

* Deferred Finance Expense (DFE)
	* Keeps track of how much you might have to pay if you don't pay in time for the Early settlement discount

Example
: 
The entity gives a cash discount of 600 MU on the order of 8000 MU
There is an early settlement discount of 400 MU if the bill is paid in 20 days
a) The buyer pays in 20 days
b) The buyer pays _after_ 20 days

Before 20 days

Inventories
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7400	|		|

Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 400	| 		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
|	| 7400		|

After 20 days

a)
Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 	| 400		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7000	| 		|
|  400	|		|

b)
Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 	| 400		|

Finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 400	| 		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7400	| 		|

#### Finance costs

> Payment in the *extended settlement period* incurs *extended settlement costs*.

If the inventories are material the *present value* at the purchasing date, and the rest of the price is to be written off as *interest expense*.

#### Transaction dates on Important goods

> **Transaction date** is the date when the *risks* and *rewards* are transferred.

Two possible systems are commonly used: FOB and DAT (see [Foreign transactions](Foreign%20transactions) above)

The foreign currency losses should be recorded accordingly.

#### Conversion costs

* Direct costs
	* Related to the good directly
* Indirect costs
	* Fixed cost
		* Do not vary with production levels
	* Variable costs
		* Vary with production levels

Depreciation related to manufacturing goods need to be transferred to the *work in progress* account.

#### Stages of Manufacturing

* Raw materials
	* Input: Purchases
	* Output: Work-in-progress
* Work-in-progress
	* Input: Raw materials
	* Output: Finished goods
* Finished goods
	* Input: Raw materials
	* Output: Sales expense

#### Accounting for the movements: Two systems

Perpetual system

* We continually keep track of both sales and purchases
* Counting of inventory is done often

Periodic system

* We update ledger account for inventory purchases, we do not update for inventories sold
* Counting of inventory is done on the year end

#### Calculating the amount to transfer: 3 cost formulae

* Specific identification
	* Each item is tracked separately (rarely used)
* Weighted average
	* The *weighted average* of the costs of different inventory accounts is used
* First In First Out (FIFO)
	* The first account added will be consumed first

#### Production suspense account

> In a **suspense account** we use the *normal amount* as the basis, and adjust based on that.

Underproduction leads to under absorption and needs to be written off as an expense. These are used in conjunction with the *budget* of the company to determine the actual production. This can be applied for manufacturing costs among others.

#### Inventory balances and stock theft

* In the *periodic* system thefts go undetected
* Stolen goods are counted as sales
* The *perpetual* inventory system accounts for the items stolen

#### Net realizable value

> **Net realizable value** is the estimated selling price of an asset, less the cost of sales.

In case of damages to the inventory the net realizable value should be deducted from the inventory amount, and counted as damages.

### Reversals of write-downs

Write-downs can be reversed if a mistake has been made

## Disclosure

All methods used for creating the financial statements must be disclosed.
