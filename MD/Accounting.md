#### Objectives
> The **objective** of financial statements is to provide useful financial information about the company to outside observers.

Users of financial information:

* Investors
* lenders
* creditors

##### Economic resources and claims against these resources
> **Economic resources** are called *assets*, claims against those resources by the owner(s) is called *equity* and claims against those resources by creditors are called *liabilities*. Resources and claims against those resources must always be *in balance*.

##### Changes in economic resources
>**Changes in the economic resources of a company** are recorded in transactions. They are reported on an *accrual* and a *cash* basis. These are reported in the *income statement* and the *statement of cash flows* respectively.

#### Qualitative characteristics and Constraints
##### Qualitative characteristics
* Relevant
	* Predictive value $\rightarrow$ Can predict future outcomes
	* Confirmatory value $\rightarrow$ Can verify past outcomes
* Faithfully represented
	* complete
	* neutral
	* free from error
* Complete
	* Nature of the assets
	* Relevant numerical information
	* Meaning of numbers
	* Method to obtain these results
* Neutral
	* Free from bias
* Free from error
	* Description of the phenomenon
	* Methods to obtain the information
	* Estimates and their limitations need to be stated
##### Applying qualitative characteristics
* Identify economic phenomena
* Identify the type of information that makes it the most relevant
* Determine whether the information can be faithfully represented
##### Enhancing qualitative characteristics
Information needs to be

* Comparable
	* Compare to previous time periods (consistency)
	* Compare to other entities (standardization)
* Verifiable
	* independent observers can make sure the representation is faithful
	* Direct verification
	* indirect verification: Checking inputs and recalculating outputs
* Timeless
	* Information needs to be available in time for users to be able to use it
* Understandable
	* Clear and understandable
##### The cost constraints of useful information
* Market values
* Accepted formulas
* Detailed information

If expensive, ignore

#### Underlying assumptions
##### Going concern assumption
> The **going concern** assumption states that the company will stay in market and not liquidate its assets in the foreseeable future (defined usually as one or two years).

### Elements of financial information
> **Assets** are resources controlled by the entity as a result of a past event from which future economic benefit is expected.

&nbsp;

> **Liabilities** are present obligations of the entity as a result of a past event the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources.

&nbsp;

> **Net income** is the net increase in economic benefits during the accounting period during the accounting period in the form of increase in assets or decrease in liabilities resulting in an increase in equity other than the contributions from equity participants. Positive net income is called **income**, negative net income is called **expense**.

&nbsp;

>**Equity** is residual assets after removing liabilities.

* Recognition
	* Record probable events, you may also report possible events
* Reliable measurement
	* Audit it
* Initial recognition
	* Report it
* Subsequent
	* Followup
* Disclosure
	* Detail about an event

### Measurements

* Historical cost method
	* Original buying price
* Present value method
	* The value of the item today
* Realizable value method
	* The price it could be sold at
* Current cost method
	* The price of getting that item today

#### Capital
Two methods

* Financial - How much equity is there
* Production - How much the company can produce

Requirement: Directors approval
Group financial statements -> grouped by year and detailed breakdowns
Different year layouts


### Standards

> The **standards** in IFRS are called IAS1. It describes how to prepare financial statements. If there is a clash between the *conceptual framework* and the standards, the standard takes priority.

#### Financial statement
* Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet)
* Statement of Comprehensive Income (Income statement)
* Statement of Changes in Equity (Owners Equity report)
* Statement of Cash Flows (Cash flow report)

#### Fair presentation
Comply with international guidelines, fairly present your numbers.

#### Departure from IFRS
A reason needs to be given

#### Going Concern
The operation is required for one year. Entity is going concern if the management does not plan to liquidate assets and/or cease trading.

#### Accrual basis
Everything is reported when it occurs.

#### Accounting chain
* Transaction
* Source document
* Journal
* Ledger
* Trial Balance
* Detailed internal financial statements
* External financial statements

#### Credit losses

Allowance for credit losses / doubtful debts

#### Compulsory additional information

Corrections -> Must be disclosed to be comparable
Annual report

Current assets/liabilities -> Short-term assets/liabilities

Dividends must be approved and disclosed in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes

## Accounting policies and correcting errors

### Accounting standards
Standards for reporting accounting information.

The accounting standard needs to be consistent, changes need to have a good reason.

All accounting policies need to be relevant and reliable.

Accounting policy needs to be disclosed.

Changes in accounting policies

* Retro $\rightarrow$ Change the accounting standard for the past two years as well
	* Previous years financial records are *fixed*. They cannot retroactively be changed
	* Adjustments need to be added to previous years in the current report
* Pro $\rightarrow$ Change is effective only *after the decision to change.* Previous years are unaffected.

### Changing Estimates

Changes in estimates are always pro. 

Gross amount - Amount *before* adjustment
Carrying amount - Amount carried over to the financial statements.

Two methods:

* Reallocation
	* Assume that the current value is correct, and calculate the depreciation depending on the expected life
	* Preferred by Prof.
* Cumulative catch-up
	* Assume the old estimate is wrong, and correct it in the current year based on that

### Correction of Errors

Errors are all retro. (restate figures)
Restated figures are on the new report.

## Foreign transactions

> **Foreign currency** is a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.
> **Functional currency** is defined as the currency of the primary economic activities of the entity.

#### Monetary items and non-monetary items

> Monetary items are items that are either cash or can be quickly converted to cash, such as:
>
* Cash
* Accounts receivable
* Accounts payable
* Provisions to be settled in cash

&nbsp;

>**Exchange rate** is the ratio of exchange between the two currencies

#### Dates

Different dates need to be determined, because the *exchange rate* fluctuates.

* Transaction date
	* The date t which point you receive the risk and reward of the item
		* FOB (Free on Board)
			* Risk transfers as soon as the item *is shipped*
		* CIF (Carriage, Insurance and Freight)
			* The risk transfers at the end of shipping
		* DAT (Delivered at Terminal)
			* The risk transfers at arrival
		* DDP (Delivered, Duty Payed)
			* The risk transfers when all duties are cleared and the item is picked up

Depending on the current state of delivery the books need to be adjusted for the exchange rate

It must be declared how you deal with changes in exchange rate.

#### Paying debts (accounts payable)

A *profit/loss on foreign exchange* needs to be recorded when paying debt or receiving payments from debtors at a different exchange rate than it was incurred on.

#### Foreign loans

> **Loans** are a form of debt that needs to be repaid *with interest.*

For *foreign loans* the interest payments need to be made in the foreign currency, thus the exchange rate needs to be accounted for. The foreign exchange profit/loss needs to be accounted for on each payment.

The debt needs to be accounted for at the *average annual interest rate*.

Example
: A debt in the FC is incurred at an interest rate of 10% p.a. with a minimum payment of 20% p.a. In 5 years the company pays back all the money

| Debt (FC) | Exchange rate | Debt (LC) | Interest expense | Exchange p/l  | Cash |
|----------:|--------------:|----------:|-----------------:|--------------:|-----:|
| 100       | 10	    | 1000	| N/A		   | N/A	   | 1000 |
| 90	    | 5		    | 450	| -100	           | 550	   |  900 |
| 80	    | 20	    | 1600	| -100		   | -1450	   |  500 |
| 70	    | 10	    | 700	| -100		   | 1000	   |  300 |
| 0	    | 15	    | 0		| -100		   | -450	   | **-750** |
| Total | (profits /| expense) | **-400** 	   | **-350**	   | **-750** |


#### Foreign currency dominated non-monetary items

These are not affected by exchange rate (i.e. they are accounted for at the *price and exchange rate of purchase*). Inventories kept in foreign currencies need to be accounted for at the *sale* of the inventory in the local currency.

### Functional currencies and presentation currencies

> IAS 21 allows entities to *present* their financial statements in any **presentation currency**. It however requires the entity to operate and calculate with its **functional currency**, that is the most used currency in the primary region of the entities operations.

All transactions need to be calculated in the functional currency, and then converted to any presentation currency in the reports.

### Statement of Cash Flows

> **Cash and cash equivalents** are currency assets, or assets quickly convertible to currency.

#### Types of Activities in the Statement of Cash Flows

* Operating activities
* Investment activities
* Financing activities

#### The Methods of Stating Cash Flows

* Direct method
	* Cash receipts
	* Add them up
* Indirect method
	* Profit before tax
	* Cash generated from operations

##### The direct method

It is important to balance out the statement of creditors and Bank.

Each T-account needs to be balanced separately

See book p. 1230ff for examples

##### The indirect method

Profit + Non-cash items = Operating profit before working capital
OPbWC - Trade receivable + Prepaid expenses - Inventories - Notes paid = 
Cash generated form operations - Interest paid - Dividends paid - Income tax = Net cash flow from operations

##### Bank overdrafts

> **Bank overdrafts** are considered *loans.* They *must* be explained in a note on the Statement of Cash flows.

#### Non-Cash Flow Transactions

> **Non-cash flow transactions** that may significantly affect future cash flows should be disclosed in a note.

## Inventories

> **Inventories** are assets to be sold, or the raw materials thereof

Properties

* Property plant and equipment
* Investment properties
* Inventories

* Retailers
	* Merchandise
* Manufacturer
	* Raw materials
	* Work-in-Progress
	* Finished goods
* Service provider
	* Consumable stores

> Stocks, bonds and biological assets are reported separately

Initial measurement

* Cost to purchase
* Conversion costs
* Other costs to bring it to current location and condition

### Taxes and Duties

Companies can usually claim back the VAT for the inventories they purchase, as theses will be paid by the consumers when these inventories are sold

* Inwards - Buying something
	* Included in costs of inventory
* Outward - Selling something
	* Included in selling expense
	* Selling expense = cost of inventory sold + selling expense

#### Rebates

* Buying for less (reduces cost of inventory)
* Assist in selling (reduces selling expenses)

#### Discounts

* Trade discount or bulk discount - Included in the negotiation price
* Cash discount - Reward for paying in cash
* Early settlement discount - Reward for paying quickly

* Deferred Finance Expense (DFE)
	* Keeps track of how much you might have to pay if you don't pay in time for the Early settlement discount

Example
: 
The entity gives a cash discount of 600 MU on the order of 8000 MU
There is an early settlement discount of 400 MU if the bill is paid in 20 days
a) The buyer pays in 20 days
b) The buyer pays _after_ 20 days

Before 20 days

Inventories
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7400	|		|

Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 400	| 		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
|	| 7400		|

After 20 days

a)
Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 	| 400		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7000	| 		|
|  400	|		|

b)
Deferred finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 	| 400		|

Finance expense
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 400	| 		|

Creditor
| Debit	| Credit	|
|-------|---------------|
| 7400	| 		|

#### Finance costs

> Payment in the *extended settlement period* incurs *extended settlement costs*.

If the inventories are material the *present value* at the purchasing date, and the rest of the price is to be written off as *interest expense*.

#### Transaction dates on Important goods

> **Transaction date** is the date when the *risks* and *rewards* are transferred.

Two possible systems are commonly used: FOB and DAT (see [Foreign transactions](Foreign%20transactions) above)

The foreign currency losses should be recorded accordingly.

#### Conversion costs

* Direct costs
	* Related to the good directly
* Indirect costs
	* Fixed cost
		* Do not vary with production levels
	* Variable costs
		* Vary with production levels

Depreciation related to manufacturing goods need to be transferred to the *work in progress* account.

#### Stages of Manufacturing

* Raw materials
	* Input: Purchases
	* Output: Work-in-progress
* Work-in-progress
	* Input: Raw materials
	* Output: Finished goods
* Finished goods
	* Input: Raw materials
	* Output: Sales expense

#### Accounting for the movements: Two systems

Perpetual system

* We continually keep track of both sales and purchases
* Counting of inventory is done often

Periodic system

* We update ledger account for inventory purchases, we do not update for inventories sold
* Counting of inventory is done on the year end

#### Calculating the amount to transfer: 3 cost formulae

* Specific identification
	* Each item is tracked separately (rarely used)
* Weighted average
	* The *weighted average* of the costs of different inventory accounts is used
* First In First Out (FIFO)
	* The first account added will be consumed first

#### Production suspense account

> In a **suspense account** we use the *normal amount* as the basis, and adjust based on that.

Underproduction leads to underabsorption and needs to be written off as an expense. These are used in conjunction with the *budget* of the company to determine the actual production. This can be applied for manufacturing costs among others.

#### Inventory balances and stock theft

* In the *periodic* system thefts go undetected
* Stolen goods are counted as sales
* The *perpetual* inventory system accounts for the items stolen

#### Net realizable value

> **Net realizable value** is the estimated selling price of an asset, less the cost of sales.

In case of damages to the inventory the net realizable value should be deducted from the inventory amount, and counted as damages.

### Reversals of write-downs

Write-downs can be reversed if a mistake has been made

## Disclosure

All methods used for creating the financial statements must be disclosed.
