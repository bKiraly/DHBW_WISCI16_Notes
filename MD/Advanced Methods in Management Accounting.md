##Basic Concepts of Accounting

See Accounting I and II

### Accrual Basis vs Cash Basis

#### Accrual basis

> Revenue recognized regardless of when the cash is received

#### Cash basis

> Revenue is only recognized when the cash is received

* Incomplete
* Fails to match efforts to improve financial positions

#### Nonprofit Organizations

* For the most part they used Cash-based accounting
* Now they are using cash-based accounting

#### Adjustments in accrual accounting

* Explicit transactions (day-to-day routine events), accounted as soon as they occur
* Implicit transactions (estimates of incoming transactions, not guaranteed), accounted for at the end of the accounting period

### Principal adjustment

* Expiration of unexpired costs
	* Unexpired costs are costs that are not paid
* Recognition of unearned revenues (deferred revenues)
	* Revenue that is not eared yet
* Accrual of unrecorded earnings and expenses
	* Interest expense and employee wages

### Dividends

* Reduce retained earnings, but are not expenses
