### Project governance

Project needs to be in-line with the organizational governance
Must define:

* Structure
* Authorization
* Oversight and accountability
* Decision making
* Resources

Roles (see above)

### Procuring external project resources

Depends on many factors
Similar to "make or buy" decisions
Business process outsourcing, including offshoring is one option for acquiring external resources

### Procurement Planning

See if (parts of) the project is outsourced
Focus on how it is done
Develop and use Request for Proposal (RFP)

### Project Charter

PMBOK see above

* Project name
* Project stakeholders
	* Names
	* Titles and roles
	* Contact details
* Project description
	* Background
	* Description of the problem
	* Desired impact
* MOV
* Project Scope
	* In- and out
* Project schedule
	* Project start- and end date
	* Timeline of milestones
	* Reviews and review dates
* Budget
	* Broken down by phase
* Quality issues
	* Specific quality requirements
* Resources Required
	* People
	* Tech
	* Facilities
	* Other
	* Resources to be provided
* Assumptions and Risks
	* See above
* Project administration
* Acceptance and approval

> **Scope** is the work that needs to be done in order to achieve success

> **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is an ordered breakdown of the tasks needed for the project

The iron triangle

* Constraints
	* Time, resources
* Driver
	* The constraint that decides upon the projects success or failure
* Floats
	* Flexible in management
* Trade-offs

> **Statement of Work (SoW)** is a narrative description of the product you are delivering

### Scope

Project oriented

* Support project management of PLC
* Deliverable Structure Chart

Product oriented

* Specific features and functionality
* First cut of requirements definitions
* Use Case Diagram

#### Deliverable Structure Chart

* Structures the deliverables
* Reflect the project steps
* Describes what needs to be done by whom, when

#### Scope validation

#### Scope Change Control

Potential issues

* Scope grope - Team can't define scope
* Scope creep - adding features after scopes approval
* Scope leap - fundamental change away of the original scope

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

* Represents logical decomposition of work to be performed
* Focuses on how the product is subdivided
* Outline of the work to be performed
* Deliverables (assignment)
* Team activity

#### Work Packages / Deliverables

* Work packages


### Estimation techniques

* Guesstimating -> Just guess
* Delphi -> Ask experts
* Time boxing -> Divide everything into time boxes
* Top down -> Top/Middle managers determine the process, lower managers break it down
* Bottom up -> Experts make estimates
* Planning poker -> Subset of the Delphi technique
* Spikes -> Break task down into smaller tasks that need to be done

### Scheduling and Budgeting

* Estimation
* Sequencing of activities
* WBS
* Objective: *realistic* schedule

#### Waterfall or Agile

Waterfall

* Good for well-understood complex requirements

Agile

* More appropriate for uncertainty
* Tight deadlines

#### Tools for developing a schedule

* Gantt Chart
	* Time frames for tasks
* Activity on the Node
	* Estimated duration
	* Predecessor
	* Activity
	* Identify the critical path -> Shortest time for the projects
* Critical Path Analysis
	* Look for critical path in the AotN chart to get minimal time to get the project done
* Program evaluation and review technique
	* Use a weighted average of pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely times (weighted 4 times more than the other two).
	* Formula: ${{a+4b+c} \over 6}$
* Precedence Diagram Method
	* Finish-to-start
	* Start-to-start
	* Start-to-finish
	* Finish-to-finish

#### Slack/Float

* Slack = The amount of time an activity can be delayed for before it delays the project
* Critical path can change
* Fast-tracking: performing serial activities in parallel

#### Lead Time

* Starting a new task before the previous task is complete
* Overlapping activities

#### Lag time

* Adding waiting time before the next task start

#### Critical Chain Project Management

* Based on the assumption that people often add buffer to compensate for the risk of finishing late
* Parkinsons law: Work fills time available
* Students Syndrome: doing tasks in the last minute
* Resource contention: Project members are assigned to many projects
	* No opportunity to focus on tasks on the critical path
	* Constraint on the entire project
* Ask each person on the team what time he can be done with a probability of 50%
* Instead of putting buffer to tasks, add buffer to project
* Feeding buffers
	* Apply to tasks that act as feeders on the critical path
	* reduce start time
* Resource buffers
	* Ensures resource availability to combat resource contention
* Project buffer
	* 50% of regular buffer

#### Rolling Wave Planning

* Minimizes planning in uncertainty
* Master schedule with detailed schedules for a few week/months

#### Budgeting

* Define what resources will be needed to perform the work
* Determine the quality of resources that are needed
* Define the cost of using each resource
* Calculate the cost of the task or activity
* Ensure resources are not over-allocated
* Sum up everything

##### Types of costs

* Direct costs
* Indirect costs
* Sunk costs
* Learning curve related costs
* Prorated costs
* Reserves

#### Stakeholder management

* Stakeholder influence and interest
* Formal organization
	* Org. chart
* Informal organization
	* Networking
	* Bypasses formal organization
	* Know as much as possible about the informal organization
* Stakeholder analysis
	* Develop a list of stakeholders
	* Identify stakeholder alignment
	* Determine the degree of influence
	* Define a role per stakeholder
	* Identify an objective per stakeholder
	* Identify a strategy per stakeholder

#### Project communication plan

* Information requirements
* Type of report or metric
* Timings/Availabilities
* Medium/Format

#### Closure plan

* Changeover
	* Direct cutover
	* Parallel
	* Phased
* Project state at the end of project
	* Normal
	* Premature
	* Perpetual
	* Failed
	* Changed priorities
* Project acceptance
* Final project - minimum requirements
	* Project summary
	* Project description
	* MOV
	* Scope, schedule, budget and quality objectives

* Final close-out meeting
	* Formally transfers product
	* Acknowledges contributions
	* Receives formal sign-off
* Deliverables until July 3rd
	* Communication plan
	* Project closure plan

### Replication

* Reasons for replication
	* Reliability
	* Performance

### Consistency

* Guaranteed consistency
	* Locking
	* Performance problems
* Eventual consistency
	* Relaxed
	* The changes will be replicated to other replicas
	* This is not a locking call
