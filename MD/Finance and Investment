| Participation	| full		| interest only	|
| Net assets	| share of eq	| repayment	|

The *fungibility* of a share is an important factor for selling shares.

### Equity Financing

* Cash comes from outside the company
* Cash comes from owners of the company
* Method depends on legal form
	* Person-related
		* The owner may inject cash from their private fund at any time

	* Person-oriented
		* The owners may increase the amount of equity
		* Additional owners may be added
	* Mixed forms
		* Fully liable shareholders
		* Limited liable shareholders
		* Shares have low fungability (They can not be sold easily)
			* Selling these shares is even more difficult due to the *asymmetry of information*
	* Capital-related company
		* They issue new shares
			* Share = Deed incorporating rights
			* Nominal value of the share = the price shares were initially sold at
				* Shows the division of ownership
				* base for dividends
			* $Number Of Shares * Nominal Share Price = Nominal Capital$
			* $Equity = Nominal Capital + Retained Earnings + Current Earnings$
			* $Book Value = {Equity*NominalValue \over NominalCapital}$
			* $EmissionPrice = BookValue / NumberOfShares$
			* $StockExchangePrice - NominalSharePrice = MarketPremium$
			* $EmissionPrice - NominalSharePrice = AGIO$
			* Shareholders are entitled to
				* attend shareholder meetings
				* full documentation of the year-end closing of the company
				* information
				* dividends
				* issue new shares in case of increase of capital stock (subscription rights)
					* $Subscription Ratio = Relative Increase In Shares$
					* $Price Of Shares = $ Weighted average of  the nominal price and market price weighted by the subscription ratio
				* prorated process in case of liquidations
			* Fungability of shares is extremely high
			* Highly regulated to avoid *insider trading*
			* Ownership quota

			* Capital increases
				* Ordinary CE

				* Approved CE
				* Nominal CE

### Valuation of a Company

If the company is on the stock market, the valuation is simple: $Stock Price * Number Of Stocks$

#### The Discounted Cash Flow Method

Used for companies not listed on the stock market
Depends on the profit and the interest rate

* We start with a timeline of cash flows.
* Then we discount future cash flows to the same point in time we're calculating from.
* Then we get a total discounted cash flow.
* This is a good indication of the valuation of the company

* Interest rate
	* Price for borrowing cash
	* Risk surcharge depending on the financial standing of the debtor
	* Overhead + Profit

### Debt vs. Equity

* Debt
	* Comes from creditors
	* No liability
	* No part of profit
* Equity
	* Participates in management
	* Share of profit
	* Fully taxable
	* Liability

Loan factors

* Term
* Interest
* Repayment
* Amount

Long-term financing

* Standard
	* Standard credit, use credit discounting formula
* Special
	* Support small enterprises
* Bond
	* No fungability
	* <15 years
* Debenture (fixed income payment)
	* Issued by entities
	* Exchange rate
	* Interest

#### Calculating the RoI of Bonds

* Nominal value $n$
* Buying price $b$
* Selling price $s$
* Term $t$
* Interest $i$

$$n*i*t - b+s$$

#### Calculating the RoI of Stocks

* Buying price $b$
* Selling price $s$
* Dividend $d$

$$\sum (d)-b+s$$

### Difference between Stocks and Bonds

| Thing 	| Stocks	| Bonds		|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Investor	| Owner		| Creditor	|
| Return	| Dividend	| Fixed interest|
| Trading	| Stock exchange| =		|
| Identifier	| ISIN		| =		|
| Term		| Open-end	| Maturity date	|
| Market price	| Currency	| Percent	|
| Drivers	| Expectations	| Rating, nominal interest - prime rate|


### Repayment models

* Block repayment
	* All debt is repayed all at once at the end of the period
* Equal installments
	* Pay a constant amount on regular intervals
* Repayment in annuities
	* $A = {c \over LoanTerm}$
	* Paid in regular intervals
	* $A = Interest + Repayment Components$
	* $A = L{(1+i)^n*i \over (1+i)^n-1}$
	* The repayment component grows progressively
	* The residual debt also decreases progressively
	* Extraordinary repayment $\rightarrow$ *Fun times*

### Short-term credit financing

* Supplier credit
	* Full repayment within 30 days
	* 2% cash discount within 10 days
	* Annual interest rate: ${DiscountRate \over 1-DiscuntRate} * {360 \over PaymentTerm - DiscountTerm}$
* Bill of Exchange
	* Amount
		* Written on the bill, includes interest
	* Seller
		* Can *go to protest* on non-payment
			* Gets hold of the buyers property without court proceedings
	* Maturity
		* On end of term
		* Can be sold early for proportional interest
	* Buyer
* Lombardloan
	* Collateralized by physical good
	* Fixed term
	* Example: pawnshop
* Guaranteed credit
	* Debtor does not receive cash, but financial standing of the creditor
	* Per se on financing, financing starts when the bond is drawn by the beneficiary
	* Akzeptkredit
	* Milestone payments $\rightarrow$ Advances received: Liabilities
	* Guaranteed by *on-demand bonds*
		* Cost money to the contractor
		* Has a per year fee of 0.25%-1%
		* Maturity $\rightarrow$ Extend or pay
		* Secure competition of contract issued by supplier, beneficiary is customer
		* Secure payment issued by the customer, beneficiary is supplier
	* Contingent liability $\rightarrow$
		* For the issuing bank
		* For the banks customer
		* If all goes well the liability is removed
		* Not in accounts, but listed in footnotes to Bill of Exchange
	* Insurance against unfair calling
* Documentary letter of credit
	* Payment is tied to the submission by the beneficiary of well-defined documents
	* If payment is due immediately after submission of documents, the L/C has no financing effect
	* Main feature of L/C is payment securely

### Loan substitutes

#### Factoring

### Financing from depreciation

Cash flows are only incurred for

* Material costs
* Personnel costs
