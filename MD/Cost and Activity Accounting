## Analysis of Financial statement

### Basics of Analysis

> **Analysis** transforms data with analytic tools to reduce uncertainty.

### Blocks of Analysis

* Liquidity and efficiency
* Solvency
* Profitability
* Market prospects

### Standards for comparison
Comparison benchmarks:

* Intracompany

* Industry
* Guidelines

### Tools for analysis

* Horizontal analysis (Comparing to the previous temporal unit)
* Vertical analysis (Comparing the base amount)
* Ratio analysis (Relations of key items between financial statements ex. Cash/Assets)

> **Common-size Statements** express the accounts as a percentage of a set total.

&nbsp;

> **Comparative balance sheets** are balance sheets with multiple different values for the same indicators, that contrast one another.

&nbsp;

> **Current assets** are balance sheet accounts that represent the value of all assets that can reasonably expect to be converted into cash within one year.

#### Ratio analysis

> **Disclaimer:** Every ratio will be included on the last page of the test.

* Liquidity and efficiency
	* Liquidity-Profit ratio
	* Ratios
		* $\text{Current ratio} = {\text{Current Assets}\over\text{Current Liabilities}}$
			* Shows the ability of a company to fulfill *short-term* obligations
			* higher is better
		* $\text{Acid-test ratio} = {Cash+\text{Short-term investments}+\text{Current receivables} \over \text{Current liabilities}}$
			* Shows the ability of a company to fulfill *short-term* investments, assuming a sale of assets
			* higher is better
			* aka. Quick ratio
		* $\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = {\text{Net sales}\over\text{Average accounts receivables net}}$
			* Indicates the ability of the company to collect on their debt
			* Average AR = Arithmetic mean of the starting AR and ending AR
		* $\text{Inventory Turnover} = {\text{Cost of goods sold}\over\text{Average inventory}}$
		* higher is better
			* Average inventory is the arithmetic mean of the beginning an the ending inventory
		* $\text{Days sales outstanding} = {\text{Accounts receivable net}\over\text{Net sales}}*365$
			* Indicates how frequently the company collects its accounts receivable
			* Lower is better
			* aka. Aging report
			* Monitored at a daily basis
		* $\text{Total Asset Turnover} = {\text{Net sales}\over \text{Average total assets}}$
			* It measures the amount of profits generated from the assets of the company
* Solvency
	* Liability-Solvency ratio
	* Debt ratio ${Liabilities \over Liability + Equity}$
	* Equity ratio ${Equity\over Liability + Equity}$

* Profitability
	* Profit Margin = ${\text{Net income} \over \text{Net sales}}$
		* Described the companies ability to earn net income on each sales dollar
	* Return on Total Assets = ${\text{Net income} \over \text{Average total assets}}$
		* Measures how well assets have been employed
	* Return on common stockholders' equity = ${\text{Net income - Preferred dividends} \over \text{Average common stockholders' equity}}$
* Market Prospects
	* Price-Earnings ratio ${\text{Market price per common share} \over \text{Earnings per share}}$
		* General gauge for investors on stock value
	* Dividend Yield ${\text{Annual cash dividends per share} \over \text{Market price per share}}$
		* Shows how profitable each share is


## Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis

$\text{Total cots} = \text{Fixed costs}+\text{Variable costs}(+\text{Target Profit})$
$Profit = Income - Costs$
$Profit = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Break-Even point}$

### Step-wise costs

> **Step-wise costs** are costs that are *constant* for in isolated regions, but on the boundaries of these regions they change value.

### Measuring costs

1. Scatter diagrams
	* Use proper scatterplots, don't just draw a line through data like the prof did. **Seriously, don't do what the prof did in your thesis.**
2. High-low method
	* You take the highest and lowest datapoint and draw a line through both. **Don't use this. Ever.**
3. Least-square regression
	* Here you look at the line with the lowest average deviation from all points, and Excel does it for you automatically. This one you can actually use, it makes a lot of sense. Be sure to note your $R^2$ rate.

### Calculating the Break-Even point

#### Contribution margin

$$
\text{Contribution margin} = \text{Sales revenue per unit} - \text{Variable costs per unit} \\
\text{Contribution margin ratio} = {\text{Contribution margin} \over \text{Sales revenue per unit}}
$$

#### The Break-Even point

$$
\text{Break-Even point} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Contribution margin per unit}} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Sales revenue per unit - Variable costs per unit}}\\
\text{Break-Even point Revenue} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Contribution margin ratio}}
$$

## Master Budgets and Planning

The budgeting is done on multiple levels.
It enhances communication between management levels, and sets goals.

> The budget, in which all other budgets are consolidated in, is called a **master budget**.

> The **Budget committee** is the group of managers from all departments of the company that discuss the budgets, and make sure all of them are coordinated and realistic.

Budgeting is a *bottom-up* process.

> A **fixed budget** is a budget that does not change.

> A **rolling budget** is a budget that can be reviewed and reevaluated as needed.

The annual budget may be divided into smaller (eg. quarterly) budgets.

Types of budgets

* Operating budget
	* Sales budget
		* Estimated unit sales
		* Estimated unit price
	* Cash budget
		* Actual columns
* CapEx (capital expenditure)
* Financial budget

## Capital Budgeting and Managerial Decisions

### Investment Factors

* Country risk
* Inflation rate
* Behavior of the market

### Capital Budgeting

> **Capital budgeting** refers to analyzing alternative long-term investments and deciding which assets to acquire or sell.

#### Factors

> **Book value** describes the *current depreciated value* of the item. It appears in financial statements.

&nbsp;

> **Salvage value** (alternatively *residual value*) describes the value of the item once it has been completely depreciated.

* Payback Period (PP)
	* Expected time to recover the initial amount
	* Ignores the Theory of the Time Value of Money
		* The value of money changes as a function of time
	* $Payback Period = {Cost Of Investment \over Annual Net Cash Flow}$ in case of linear cash flows
	* Ignores cash flows after the payback period
	* Double Decline Balance Depreciation (DDB Depreciation)
		* Declines by percentage of remainder each year
* Account Rate of Return (ARR)
	* $ARR = {Annual Net Income \over Annual Average Investment}$
	* Factors
		* Risk
		* PP
		* Return for long time period
	* $Annual Average Investment = {Initial Investment + Scrap Value \over 2}$ for linear depreciation
* **Net Present Value (NPV) and Profitability Index**
	* Present Value Factor (PVF)
		* $PVF = {1 \over (1+rr)^n}$
		* $r$ is the interest rate; $n$ is the time to pass to regain the money
		* $PV = PVF * FV$
		* $FV$ is future value
		* Profitability Index: $Profitability Index = NPV / Investment$
* **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
	* The interest rate, which makes the NPV = 0
	* Present value of annuity table
		* $PV = {1-{1 \over r}\over r}$
	* Uneven cash flows $\rightarrow$ spreadsheets/brute force
	* There is a *hurdle rate*, which is the limit of the IRR

## Decision making

* Define task
* Identify alternative actions
* Collect relevant information
* Select the course of action
* Analyze and assess decisions made

### Relevant costs

* Costs that are applicable to a particular application
* Costs that Costs that are available
* Costs that influence decisions
* Future costs differ between alternatives

> **Sunk costs** are the results of past decisions and can not change by any current or future decisions. They are *irrelevant.*

&nbsp;

> **Out-of-Pocket costs** are future outlays of cash associated with a decision. They are *relevant.*

&nbsp;

> **Opportunity costs** are the potential benefits given up to take the current decision. They are *relevant.*

### Make or Buy decisions

> **Make or Buy decisions** are decisions about whether to develop something in-house, or outsource it/buy it on the market.

* Incremental costs need to be taken into account
* Cost must include
	* Direct material costs
	* Direct labor costs
	* *Incremental overhead*
* The predetermined overhead rate should not be used to determine the product cost

### Scrap or Rework decisions

> **Scrap or Rework decisions** are decisions on when to abandon a failed project or product, and when to try to save it.

&nbsp;

> As long as the *rework costs* are covered through the sale of the product, and rework does not interfere with normal production, it is worth it to rework the product.

### Sell or Process decisions

> **Sell or Process decisions** are decisions on whether to *process the product* into something more valuable, or to sell it at its normal price.

### Sales Mix Selection

* Product portfolio
* Informed managerial decision about
	* Contribution margin of each product
	* Facilities to produce each product
	* Demand for each product

### Quality Factors in Decisions

* Quality
* Delivery
* Supplier reputation
* Employee morale
* Customer opinion

### Break-Even point

The point at which the costs are returned

## Planning processes

* Planning
	* Makes decisions
* Control
	* Evaluate decisions made by planning
