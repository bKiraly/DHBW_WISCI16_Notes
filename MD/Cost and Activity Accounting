## Accounting Information Systems

### Fundamental System Principles
* Control
	* Management can control and monitor activities
* Relevance
	* Useful, understandable data
* Flexibility
	* Adapt to change
* Compatibility
	* Fit into the company
* Cost-Benefit Principle
	* Net benefit needs to be positive

### Ledgers and Journals
Special Journals

* Sales journal
* Cash receipts journal
* Purchases journal
* Cash disbursements journal
* General journal

Subsidiary ledgers

* Collect similar accounts
* These appear as one item in the general ledger
* Can be looked up in the subsidiary ledger

Digital divide $\rightarrow$ Divide between people who have access to IT systems, and those who don't.

### IT in Accounting

* Off-the-shelf software
* Integrated software

## Analysis of Financial statement

### Basics of Analysis

> **Analysis** transforms data with analytic tools to reduce uncertainty.

### Blocks of Analysis

* Liquidity and efficiency
* Solvency
* Profitability
* Market prospects

### Standards for comparison
Comparison benchmarks:

* Intracompany
* Competitors
* Industry
* Guidelines

### Tools for analysis

* Horizontal analysis (Comparing to the previous temporal unit)
* Vertical analysis (Comparing the base amount)
* Ratio analysis (Relations of key items between financial statements ex. Cash/Assets)

> **Common-size Statements** express the accounts as a percentage of a set total.

&nbsp;

> **Comparative balance sheets** are balance sheets with multiple different values for the same indicators, that contrast one another.

#### Ratio analysis

> **Disclaimer:** Every ratio will be included on the last page of the test.

* Liquidity and efficiency
	* Liquidity-Profit ratio
	* Ratios
		* $\text{Current ratio} = {\text{Current Assets}\over\text{Current Liabilities}}$
			* Shows the ability of a company to fulfill *short-term* obligations
			* higher is better
		* $\text{Acid-test ratio} = {Cash+\text{Short-term investments}+\text{Current receivables} \over \text{Current liabilities}}$
			* Shows the ability of a company to fulfill *short-term* investments, assuming a sale of assets
			* higher is better
			* aka. Quick ratio
		* $\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = {\text{Net sales}\over\text{Average accounts receivables net}}$
			* Indicates the ability of the company to collect on their debt
			* Average AR = Arithmetic mean of the starting AR and ending AR
		* $\text{Inventory Turnover} = {\text{Cost of goods sold}\over\text{Average inventory}}$
		* higher is better
			* Average inventory is the arithmetic mean of the beginning an the ending inventory
		* $\text{Days sales outstanding} = {\text{Accounts receivable net}\over\text{Net sales}}*365$
			* Indicates how frequently the company collects its accounts receivable
			* Lower is better
			* aka. Aging report
			* Monitored at a daily basis
		* $\text{Total Asset Turnover} = {\text{Net sales}\over \text{Average total assets}}$
			* It measures the amount of profits generated from the assets of the company
* Solvency
	* Liability-Solvency ratio
	* Debt ratio ${Liabilities \over Liability + Equity}$
	* Equity ratio ${Equity\over Liability + Equity}$

* Profitability
	* Profit Margin = ${\text{Net income} \over \text{Net sales}}$
		* Described the companies ability to earn net income on each sales dollar
	* Return on Total Assets = ${\text{Net income} \over \text{Average total assets}}$
		* Measures how well assets have been employed
	* Return on common stockholders' equity = ${\text{Net income - Preferred dividends} \over \text{Average common stockholders' equity}}$
* Market Prospects
	* Price-Earnings ratio ${\text{Market price per common share} \over \text{Earnings per share}}$
		* General gauge for investors on stock value
	* Dividend Yield ${\text{Annual cash dividends per share} \over \text{Market price per share}}$
		* Shows how profitable each share is


## Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis

$\text{Total cots} = \text{Fixed costs}+\text{Variable costs}(+\text{Target Profit})$
$Profit = Income - Costs$
$Profit = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Break-Even point}$

### Step-wise costs

> **Step-wise costs** are costs that are *constant* for in isolated regions, but on the boundaries of these regions they change value.

### Measuring costs

1. Scatter diagrams
	* Use proper scatterplots, don't just draw a line through data like the prof did. **Seriously, don't do what the prof did in your thesis.**
2. High-low method
	* You take the highest and lowest datapoint and draw a line through both. **Don't use this. Ever.**
3. Least-square regression
	* Here you look at the line with the lowest average deviation from all points, and Excel does it for you automatically. This one you can actually use, it makes a lot of sense. Be sure to note your $R^2$ rate.

### Calculating the Break-Even point

#### Contribution margin

$$
\text{Contribution margin} = \text{Sales revenue per unit} - \text{Variable costs per unit} \\
\text{Contribution margin ratio} = {\text{Contribution margin} \over \text{Sales revenue per unit}}
$$

#### The Break-Even point

$$
\text{Break-Even point} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Contribution margin per unit}} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Sales revenue per unit - Variable costs per unit}}\\
\text{Break-Even point Revenue} = {\text{Fixed costs} \over \text{Contribution margin ratio}}
$$
